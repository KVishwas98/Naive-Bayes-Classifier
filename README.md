Naive Bayes is a machine learning method you can use to predict the likehood
that an event will occur given evidence that's present in your data.

Three types of Naive Bayes Models

1. Multinomial - Good for when your features (categorical or continuous)
	describe discrete frequency counts (e.g. word counts)

2. Bernoulli - Good for making predictions from binary features.

3. Gaussian - Good for making predictions from normally distributed features.


Naive Bayes Use Cases
1. Spam Detection
2. Customer Classification
3. Credit Risk Prediction
4. Health Risk Prediction

Naive Bayes Assumption

1. Predictors are independent of each other.
2. A priori assumption: This is an assumption that the past conditions still hold true.
	when we make predictions from histrorucal values, we will get incorrect results
	if present circumstances have changes.
3. ALl regression models maintain an a priori assumption as well.
